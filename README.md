# Founder’s Office Execution Tracker

## Overview
This repository contains a simulated execution-tracking system designed to reflect how a Founder’s Office monitors cross-functional initiatives, identifies execution bottlenecks, and provides clear weekly updates to leadership in a fast-growing consumer technology company.

The focus of this project is execution visibility, ownership clarity, and follow-through — not strategy formulation.

## Problem Statement
As organizations scale rapidly, multiple initiatives run in parallel across teams. Without a structured tracking mechanism, leadership often faces reduced visibility into ownership, timelines, risks, and execution gaps, leading to delays and reactive decision-making.

This project demonstrates a simple, practical system to improve accountability and execution transparency.

## What This Project Includes
- A centralized initiative tracker capturing ownership, timelines, status, dependencies, and next actions
- Simulated weekly execution updates to reflect real-world delays and progress
- Bottleneck and root-cause analysis based on execution patterns
- A one-page, leadership-ready weekly status report

## Scope & Assumptions
- The initiatives and data used are simulated for demonstration purposes
- The system is intentionally kept simple to mirror real Founder’s Office workflows
- No proprietary or company-specific data has been used

## Skills Demonstrated
- Founder’s Office execution support
- Operations tracking and reporting
- Cross-functional coordination
- Process discipline and follow-up management
- Leadership communication and prioritization

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets
- Structured documentation and reporting

## Use Case
Designed to reflect the expectations of Founder’s Office, Business Operations, and Program Management roles in high-growth startups.
